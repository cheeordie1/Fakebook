My ajax wrapper is a function called ajaxSearch. When called by a function, it takes a method ("GET" or "POST") and a url and a handler function pointer and creates an ajax request to the url with the given method. When the readystate changes (i.e. a response is returned or otherwise), the handler function is called. It is reuseable because all of the parameters that create an http request are stateless and can be input to send any ajax xmlHttpRequest. One example in which my ajaxSearch can be used is to request a GET method from youtube to load a video. The readystate function handler just needs to be one that knows how to handle video data, but that is up to the user. Another situation might be to GET a newsfeed from Facebook.com. Once again, the functionality depends on how the ajaxSearch handles the payload, and that is left in the hands of the one who uses it at call time.
